# air-quality-proj2
<h1>Analyzing air quality of 500 densely populated cities</h1>
<h2>Project Motivation</h2>
<p>
With the recent wildfire in northern California that started in Camp Butte and proceeded to be the most destructive and deadly wildfire in California history - and which significantly affected air quality hundreds of miles away - air quality was on the forefront of our minds and we found it prudent to do analyses of the air quality of differnt cities around the world.
