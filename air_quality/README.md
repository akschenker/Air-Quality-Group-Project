# air-quality-proj2

## Analyzing air quality of 400 densely populated cities

### Project Motivation

With the recent wildfire in northern California that started in Camp Butte and proceeded to be the most destructive and deadly wildfire in California history - and which significantly affected air quality hundreds of miles away - air quality was on the forefront of our minds and we found it prudent to do analyses of the air quality of differnt cities around the world.

### Tools used for ETL, analysis, and visualizing

We used a wide range of tools with differing use cases to complete this project.

* [Breezometer API](https://docs.breezometer.com/api-documentation/air-quality-api/v2/)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python (pandas, Flask)
* MongoDB
* HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* JavaScript libraries:
  * [D3 (Data Driven Documents)](https://d3js.org/)
  * [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
